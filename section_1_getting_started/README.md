# What is CSS?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The core idea behind CSS is to make our webpage look good. CSS allows us to style the HTML content. It allows us to add things like colors, shadows, and all kind of visual effects, position elements differently. Basically, it allows us to change our boring HTML page into an exciting good looking website.

# CSS History, Present, and Future

- CSS was first introduced in 1996. We refer to this as CSS version 1 (i.e., CSS 1). After 2 years, we got CSS version 2 (i.e., CSS 2 in 1998). The latest version of CSS is CSS version 3. (i.e., CSS 3). CSS 3 is still under development. We won't be getting any version 4 of CSS. The reason for this is that with CSS 3, the concept or approach towards the development of CSS changed. Rather than focusing on different versions, CSS is now organized by the features covered. Things like modules which focuses on colors, shadows, texts, animations. We get different versions of these modules.
